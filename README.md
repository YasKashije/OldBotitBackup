Bot-It is a image recognition clicker. You select what window you want it to target, and it will search the desired images and click on them. The way it works is quite simple: You will have a "flow" or a succession of scans. When an image in that flow is detected in the grabbed window, it will click on it, if the image is not detected, it will scan for the next one. Once it reaches the end of the flow, will start from the beginning, until its stopped by the user, or a certain breakpoint is reached (since some games have anti-botting policies, Bot-It will stop by itself if it has been working for too long).
